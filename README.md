# Sentiment-Analysis-Microsoft-API
Exercise to use the Cognitive Service API of Microsoft.

## How it works
You can use the text1 function to get the sentence you want to anlyze. In this case it is simply
embedded within the function: 
"Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him."

Run the Sentiment_MS_REST_API.R, which creates the required POST call to the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services and obtain the following gauge.
